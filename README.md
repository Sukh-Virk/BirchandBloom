# Birch & Bloom Counselling Website

# Still In development!!
https://birchandbloom.netlify.app/

## Overview
This project delivers a custom, responsive website for **Birch & Bloom Counselling**, a mental health practice offering a safe, judgment-free space for exploring thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The site is designed to showcase the practice’s core services, introduce the counsellor, provide resources, and make it easy for clients to get in touch or book a session.

## Client Requirements
- **Brand alignment**: Use the client’s color palette (earthy tones), typography (Montserrat & Playfair Display), and imagery (floral accents) to reinforce a warm, welcoming vibe.  
- **Responsive design**: Ensure that content adapts cleanly from mobile phones (portrait) to desktop (wide screens).  
- **Clear navigation**: Logical menu grouping for Home, About, Services, Resources, and Contact.  
- **Accessibility**: Alt text on images, high-contrast buttons, legible font sizes, and keyboard-navigable links.  
- **Contact & booking**: Integration of a contact form and “Book Now” button that links to the scheduling system.  
- **Performance**: Optimize images, use modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid), and minimize render-blocking assets.

## Features
- **Hero section** with full-width background and tagline  
- **About section** outlining the counsellor’s background, approach, and philosophy  
- **Services overview** with icons and brief descriptions  
- **Resources/blog** placeholder for articles, self-help guides, and recommended reading  
- **Testimonials carousel** to build trust and social proof  
- **Contact form** (name, email, message) with validation and confirmation message  
- **Footer** with social links, privacy policy, and copyright

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5** & **CSS3** (custom styles, variables for theme colors)  
- **JavaScript** (vanilla for interactive elements such as mobile menu toggling and form validation)  
- **Google Fonts** (Montserrat, Playfair Display)  
- **Normalize.css** for cross-browser consistency  
- **Netlify** (or GitHub Pages) for continuous deployment  
- **Accessibility tools** (axe-core) integrated into the build pipeline
