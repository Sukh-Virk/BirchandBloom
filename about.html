      <h1>Hello, I’m Arandeep Virk,</h1>
      <h2>the founder of Birch & Bloom Counselling</h2>
      <p>As a Registered Social Worker (RSW) with a Master of Social Work (MSW) from the University of British Columbia, I bring over four years of experience in mental health and substance use, working with individuals, youth, and families. My approach is compassionate, evidence-based, and tailored to support your unique needs on the path to healing and personal growth.</p>

  <!-- ================= JOURNEY SECTION ================= -->
  <section class="journey-section animate-on-scroll">
    <div class="journey-container">
      <h2 class="journey-title">My Journey</h2>
      <p class="journey-text">My passion for counselling began long before I became a therapist. It started with a simple yet powerful realization—when people are truly heard and supported, they can begin to heal. One of my first experiences in the field was working in a transition home for women and children fleeing violence, where I witnessed firsthand how a safe and compassionate space could transform lives. That experience stayed with me, shaping the way I approach my work today.</p>
      <p class="journey-text">Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of supporting individuals and families through some of life’s most challenging moments. I have worked as a registered social worker in hospital settings, long-term care, and community-based mental health services, walking alongside clients facing anxiety, grief, trauma, substance use, and major life transitions. At BC Children’s Hospital, I worked closely with children and families navigating complex medical and emotional challenges, helping them find strength in uncertainty. In the emergency department and ICU, I provided crisis support for individuals and families in critical moments of distress.</p>
      <p class="journey-text">Through these experiences, I have learned that therapy is not about "fixing" people—it’s about empowering them to reconnect with their strengths, find clarity, and move toward healing in their own way.</p>

      <h2>A Commitment to Inclusion & Individualized Care</h2>
      <p>Working with neurodiverse children and youth has strengthened my dedication to creating inclusive and supportive environments where every voice is honored.</p>
      <p>Whether working with children, families, or adults, I believe in meeting people where they are—tailoring approaches to fit individual strengths and needs.</p>
      <p><strong>At Birch & Bloom Counselling,</strong> I strive to create a space where clients feel seen, heard, and valued—because I truly believe that <em>healing begins with feeling understood.</em></p>
