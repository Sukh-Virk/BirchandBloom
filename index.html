          <summary>What is a consultation, and do I need one before starting therapy?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              A consultation is a brief, no-obligation meeting to determine if therapy is the right fit. It provides an opportunity to ask questions, learn about the approach used in sessions, and discuss your needs before committing to ongoing therapy.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>
  
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the process for starting therapy?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The first step is to book a 15-minute consultation. This is an opportunity to determine whether the therapeutic relationship is a good fit. During this conversation, we will discuss what you are looking for in therapy, how support can be provided, and address any questions you may have.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we decide to move forward, the first full session will focus on gaining a deeper understanding of your concerns and goals. Together, we will begin developing a personalized care plan, which may include identifying key areas of focus, setting therapeutic goals, and determining session frequency. Therapy is a collaborative process, and as your needs evolve, the approach will be adjusted to ensure it remains effective and meaningful.

          <summary>How do I prepare for my first session?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <ul>
              <li>Find a quiet, private space where you can openly and safely share your concerns (for virtual sessions).</li>
              <li>Arrive on time for the appointment to ensure you have the full session to focus on your concerns.</li>
              <li>Engage actively in the process—therapy is most effective when approached with curiosity and a willingness to explore.</li>
              <li>Consistency is key—regular attendance allows for steady progress.</li>
              <li>Be prepared for between-session work—you may receive strategies or exercises to apply in daily life, helping reinforce what’s discussed in therapy.</li>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is therapy confidential?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, therapy sessions are confidential, and information shared with your counsellor is protected. However, there are three <strong>legal exceptions</strong> to confidentiality:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Risk of harm</strong> – If there is a serious risk of harm to yourself or others, steps will be taken to ensure safety, which may include notifying appropriate authorities.</li>
              <li><strong>Suspected child abuse or neglect</strong> – If there is reason to believe a child is being abused or neglected, it must be reported to child protection authorities.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> – If required by law (e.g., subpoena, court order), information may need to be disclosed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Any exceptions to confidentiality will always be discussed with you whenever possible.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>
  
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does billing and insurance coverage work?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              After each session, an invoice will be provided, which can be submitted to your insurance provider for reimbursement. At this time, direct billing is not available, and payment is required at the time of the session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coverage for counselling services provided by a Registered Social Worker (RSW) may vary depending on your extended health benefits plan. To determine whether your sessions are covered, please check with your insurance provider and ask if your plan includes counselling or psychotherapy services by a RSW.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recognizes social work as a health profession, and counselling services provided by a RSW may be claimed as a medical expense on income tax returns. Moreover, RSW-provided clinical services are GST-exempt in British Columbia.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I book a session, and what is your booking policy?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Sessions can be booked online through our Jane App portal. If you are a new client, it is recommended to start with a 15-minute consultation to discuss your needs before scheduling a full session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Appointments are available by booking only. If you need to cancel or reschedule, at least 24 hours’ notice is required to avoid a cancellation fee.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I know if my therapist is the right fit for me?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Finding the right counsellor is essential for meaningful progress in therapy. A good fit means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Feeling comfortable and at ease in sessions.</li>
              <li>Being heard and understood through active listening and empathy.</li>
              <li>Having your values, beliefs, and opinions respected.</li>
              <li>Receiving collaborative guidance, rather than being told what to do.</li>
              <li>Feeling supported, validated, and motivated toward your goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If a counsellor doesn’t feel like the right match, it’s okay to explore other options. Therapy should be a space where you feel safe, supported, and empowered.
